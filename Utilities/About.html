        Enter the password of which strength you would like to check, and click
        enter <br />
        The provided password will be analyzed in terms of previous breaches,
        length, complexity, pattern, and language, and results will be provided
        on the screen. <br />
        Results will be separated into 3 tiers:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Tier 1: The scale will show a result in red. This means the provided
            password is less than 25% secure, making it extremely vulnerable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tier 2: The scale will show a result in yellow. This means the
            provided password is between 25% and 50% secure, making it mildly
            vulnerable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tier 3: The scale will show a result in green. This means the
            provided password is above 50% secure, making it relatively less
            vulnerable.

      <strong><span style="font-size: 20px">Context</span></strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
      The initial vague mission of our project was to create a tool that tackles
      the biggest security risk that ordinary users face in their day-to-day
      lives while using programs and websites that make use of passwords as a
      means of authentication. However, after careful consideration and
      discussion, we all came to a unanimous agreement that the biggest security
      risk people face today isn&rsquo;t genius hackers with powerful computers,
      it&apos;s themselves. Overtime, softwares have evolved and attempted to
      create ways to keep our accounts secure from breaches. For example,
      &lsquo;requiring&rsquo; passwords that are longer, and have more
      specifications with regards to symbols, capitalization, and the likes is
      used as a means of ensuring a password that is well outside the domain of
      easily leakable and/or guessable ones.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then, however, we (the users) still manage to come up with something
      like &ldquo;Password#12345678900000000000&rdquo;. As long as we as
      human-beings remain lazy, no system can keep our information completely
      secure.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Our project targets one of Saltzer and Schroeder&rsquo;s guiding
      principles for security design: psychological acceptability. In order to
      come up with an idea, we listed out the following key observations
      we&rsquo;ve made:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Users tend to incorporate their personal information into their
          passwords as a means of making it easily memorable&hellip;in
          today&rsquo;s world, a simple google search of their birthday can lead
          to anyone having access to their personal accounts. Furthermore,
          including possibly private information in their passwords puts them at
          an even larger risk.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Users tend to use universally memorable combinations of letters and
          numbers in an attempt to make it memorable. Passwords like
          &lsquo;123456&rsquo; are extremely susceptible to what we call
          &lsquo;dictionary attacks.&rsquo;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Users tend to make their passwords easy to regurgitate and type out so
          they can save time later on. For instance, &lsquo;QWERTY&rsquo; is an
          example of a password that allows you to simply slide your finger
          across your keyboard.&nbsp;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This is the most important one:&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      After asking some people, we&rsquo;ve determined that users are simply
      unaware of the specific dangers following the passwords they select. Most
      people assume adding an extra &lsquo;0&rsquo; at the end of their birthday
      is all they need to be secure.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1>
      <strong><span style="font-size: 20px">Description</span></strong>
    </h1>
    <p>There will be several key features on the website:</p>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Displaying password statistics:&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This feature tackles the unawareness problem existent among users. A user
      can input a password, and using existing APIs and databases, our website
      will display the following information:
      <br />
      <li>
        Number of Breaches: How many times the password has been leaked before.
      </li>
      <li>
        Common Dictionary Words: Whether or not the password includes any basic
        english words that susceptible to guessing, and what they are.
      </li>
      <li>Length of the Password.</li>
      <li>
        Complexity: An analysis of how the password makes use of uppercase
        characters, numbers, and symbols.
      </li>
      <li>
        Common Patterns: Whether or not the password includes common password
        patterns that, again, can make it susceptible to a dictionary attack.
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      This will help users understand the importance of choosing strong
      passwords that are not easily guessable.
    </p>

    <ol start="2">
      <li>
        <p>Visual Scale</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The website includes a visual meter that allows the user to visualize the
      degree of how vulnerable their password is, on a scale of 1-100. Using
      animations and color schemes, visual learners can better comprehend the
      degree of their password's strength.
    </p>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>
        <p>Custom Password</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Our website is also a password generator, but not ones that look like
      &lsquo;jdklf;ajkd;a$$$$%dfd&rsquo; that chrome auto generates (no one
      wants to memorize that).&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, it will utilize a database of a plethora of questions (similar to
      the &lsquo;security questions&rsquo; that most websites use). When a user
      wants a custom password, our website prompts the user with 3 of those
      questions (randomly selected). It will then take the answers, and use an
      algorithm that scrambles, salts, and adds random elements to them to
      create a new password. This way, the password is less guessable and prone
      to attacks (like the dictionary attack), but more memorable for the user
      since it includes aspects of their personal information.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Ex:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Question: What is your last name?</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Smith</p>
    <p>Question: When did you graduate high-school?</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2020</p>
    <p>Question: What is your favorite vegetable?</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tomato</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Auto Generated password: Th0tom20ato2Smi</p>

    <ol start="4">
      <li>
        <p>Display statistics of new password</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Yes, we want to keep ourselves accountable as well! We will present the
      statistics showing the strength of the generated passwords compared to
      commonly used passwords or the password you use.
